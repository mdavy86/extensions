This repository is all of the public MediaWiki extensions developed by [Organic Design](http://www.organicdesign.co.nz) which are not 
in the official MediaWiki repository, mainly due to them being of too much of a specific nature 
to be useful for the main repository. 

All the code is released under the GPL2 license and is indicated in the main file of the source 
of each extension.
